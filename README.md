BME680:
===========
![BME680](https://github.com/linux-downey/picture_repository/blob/master/BME680.png)
BME680 is an integrated environmental sensor developed specifically for mobile applications and wearables where size and low power consumption are key requirements.It also supports four kinds of numerical measurements of temperature, humidity, gas and air pressure.  

Usage:
==========
***Bme680 supports IIC and SPI communication protocols.***
If the user uses IIC protocol,The main functions are as follows，And the results of mesurements stored in struct of ***bme680.sensor_result_value***.

	Seeed_BME680 bme680(IIC_ADDR); //IIC_ADDR is address of IIC device
	bme680.init();
	bme680.read_sensor_data();

If user uses SPI protocol,The main functions are as follows，And the results of mesurements stored in struct of ***bme680.sensor_result_value***.

	Seeed_BME680 bme680();//if user uses default pins of UNO development board.(cs-10,mosi-11,miso-12,sck-13)
	//  Seeed_BME680 bme680(BME_CS, BME_MOSI, BME_MISO,  BME_SCK);//if user customizes pin of SPI hardware interface.
	bme680.init();
	bme680.read_sensor_data();

***user also can downloads the source code and running it on arduino IDE,More details in /examples***
